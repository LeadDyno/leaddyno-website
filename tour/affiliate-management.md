##Affiliate Management

Affiliates can track their own progress in real-time via their [Affiliate Dashboard](/guide/affiliate-dashboard.html).  You will provide them with a unique link to their dashboard, so that they can monitor their visitors, leads, customers, and payments.

###Managing the Affiliate Dashboard

You can customize the entire look, feel, and content of the **Affiliate Dashboard**, and/or embed it within your own application.

###Affiliate Link Sharing

Affiliates can access their unique referral link below the welcome message in the dashboard. They can also share their link with a single click by clicking the social share button for Email, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google +, and Facebook.

You can provide the initial promotional copy for each medium via the [Social Content](/guide/affiliate-social-media-marketing.html) section.

###Additional Promotional Materials

Promotional materials for websites – such as banner ads – are located under the **Promo Materials** tab within the **Affiliate Dashboard**. The HTML for each banner already contains their affiliate link, so they can simply copy/paste the HTML directly into their site.

###Affiliate Welcome & Weekly Emails

Send a customized welcome email to new affiliates as they come onboard. Also, configure a weekly progress email that is sent automatically to update your affiliates on their leads and sales, keeping them actively engaged in the promotion of your product.

Use the dynamic content variables to show your affiliates their statistics for the past week. You can also use these variables to remind them of their affiliate link, and where they can access their [Affiliate Dashboard](/guide/affiliate-dashboard.html) for this information in real-time.
