##Online Marketing Essentials

Next time you invest in pay-per-click marketing, banner ads, and/or sponsored emails, use LeadDyno to track your results and calculate your return on investment.

###PPC Conversion Tracking

We recommend using a unique LeadDyno tracking link for each Ad Group you are running within Google Adwords.  Place this link as the Actual URL for each ad that you create within the Ad Group.

*The bottom field contains a LeadDyno tracking link for this ad.*

This will place your pay-per-click lead and conversion tracking alongside your other marketing channels, so that you can compare the various mediums and campaigns side by side.

Here’s an example of an Adwords campaign, compared with a banner ad campaign (Attorney At Work), and email campaign (TechnoLawyer), and a Google Adsense campaign (Excel Timesheet).  Our Adwords campaign brought us only the third-highest amount of clicks – but it brought the most leads, and more conversions than the other three campaigns combined!

*Our Google Adwords campaign (top row) trumps the following three when comparing leads, and especially conversions.*

###Email Conversion Tracking

When composing your email copy, use a LeadDyno campaign tracking link in your call to action – and any other links to your site in the email.

This will assure that LeadDyno tracks all visitors, leads, and sales that result from your email campaign.

###Lead Follow Up Emails

You can setup lead follow up emails that are sent automatically to your new leads when they sign up for your list and/or purchase your product. Lead follow up emails are an excellent way to engage customers and prospects in a highly scalable and automated manner.
