# The site for leaddyno.com

Pretty sweet site, isn't it?

## HOWTO

This site depends on a few different technologies:

  * http://jekyllrb.com/
  * http://lesscss.org/
  * http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/

My recommended workflow is to check the project out and run

    $ jekyll serve --watch

which will automatically recompile the site when you make changes and serve
everything up at http://localhost:4000/ in a true web-server environment.
