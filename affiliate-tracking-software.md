##Quick Affiliate Setup - Get Traffic Right Away
LeadDyno is optimized for fast affiliate setup - so that your affiliates can begin sending you traffic immediately. Affiliates will send traffic to your
website via their **unique referral link**, which tracks the visitors, leads, and most importantly, customers that each affiliate sends.

*Each affiliate’s unique tracking link can be shared with a single-click.*

####Your Site’s Visitors, Leads, and Customers Defined


* A **Visitor** is someone that clicks  to your website. LeadDyno tracks the original source of this click (ie. affiliate, pay-per-click ad, blog post, tweet).
* A **Lead** is someone who gives you their email address (ie. signs up for your free newsletter).
* A **Customer** is a lead who purchases your product.

LeadDyno tracks every sale back to its original lead source – no matter how much time passes between the conversion and its initial click – so that you always know exactly where every lead and customer came from.

##Affiliate Dashboard for Real-Time Progress Updates

Your affiliates can track their own progress in real-time via their [Affiliate Dashboard](http://leaddyno.com/affiliate-dashboard/).  You will provide them with a unique link to their dashboard, so that they can monitor the  visitors, leads, customers, and commissions they have received credit for.

*Each affiliate can view their progress and upcoming commissions in real-time.*

The Affiliate Dashboard is an important resource for keeping affiliates engaged in their sales efforts. The real-time access to their statistics is both reassuring and motivating, as they can be sure that they are getting credit for the traffic they send your way. Many LeadDyno users advertise this capability front and center when they bring on new affiliates.
