Here's how to get a Facebook App ID for your website.  First, you need to have a Facebook account. If you
don't have one already, go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">www.facebook.com</a> and sign up for one.
After you have that done, go to <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/">developers.facebook.com</a>.
Now to get started!

Look to the top right corner. There will be a green *Register Now* button. Click it.

In the window that pops up, check the boxes to accept the terms of use, and click on the *Accept* button. Then hit
*Continue.*

They will then ask you to verify your account via your phone (or potentially your email). Select which country you live
in, enter in your phone number and click *Continue*. They will send you a text in which you will use to verify your
account.

After confirming your number, facebook gives you the option to set your privacy settings which connects back to your
normal Facebook page. After you've got that set to your liking, click *Continue*.

Next Facebook asks about you. You can choose to skip this step if you want. Also make sure to note the prechecked boxes
at the bottom of the page for liking the page and receiving email notifications. If you don't want this, uncheck 
the boxes before clicking *Continue* or *Skip*.

*Congratulations!* You're now a Facebook developer!! Still not quite finished though. To get a Facebook App ID,
you have to go through a few more steps. Click *Done*.

At the top of your screen there is the menu bar. Click on *Apps*.

Now in the top right corner of the screen, underneath your profile name, click the *Create New App* button.

A window will pop up. Name your App, and click *Continue*.

A security check pops up. Enter the captcha to verify you're human, and click *Continue*.

You'll be taken to your Apps > Settings > Basic menu that contains your App ID and information. Since
it's your first time here, facebook will ask you if you want to Host your site on Heroku. You can create it, or
cancel it as you want.

Now you're all set! You have your Facebook App ID. There is just one last thing before you can make it public.
Facebook automatically puts your App into Sandbox mode. To get out of it, go to (or remain in) your Apps &lt;
Settings &lt; Basic menu. Look underneath where your App ID information is, in the Basic Info section. At the bottom
there will be the option for Sandbox Mode. Simply click the bubble for the *Disabled* option. Now you're all set
up. I hope this was helpful.
