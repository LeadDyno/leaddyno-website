Now that you've decided to start an affiliate program so that your partners and customers can refer your product, let's 
talk about some affiliate recruitment strategies for building and empowering your virtual and commission-based sales 
team.

### Step 1: Inbound Affiliate Recruitment via Your Website

You should have a dedicated page on your website describing your affiliate program, and making it easy for potential 
affiliates to sign up and get rolling.  Make the link to this page obvious - either available from your top header, or
bottom footer.

I've found that the real key to ramping up as many affiliates as you can, as quickly as you can, is to get them approved
and rolling right away.  We recommend having this process automated, so that affiliates can sign up and immediately
receive their unique referral link.  Everything flows a lot smoother if the affiliate can get started without waiting
for the official stamp of approval from your affiliate manager.

### Step 2: Plug Your Affiliate Program in Email Follow Ups

Your most enthusiastic evangelists are often your existing users and customers - so you should remind them early and
often about your affiliate program.  While having a dedicated page on your website is a good start, our experience is
that you'll recruit 5-10x or more affiliates when you plug your referral program in email follow ups to your users.

### Example: SaaS Affiliate Recruitment

Our sister company, [automatic time tracking software](http://chrometa.com) developer Chrometa, uses LeadDyno to manage
its affiliate program.  Here's the copy used by Chrometa in email follow ups to trial users and new customers:

> **Refer Chrometa, Earn $100 Per Referral**
>
> Do your friends and colleagues also need a hand tracking their billable and project time? Please send them our way!
>
> Earn $100 per referral with your unique affiliate link. [log into Chrometa](https://app.chrometa.com/login) and
> navigate to **Account - Refer Us** to retrieve your link.
>
> Here you'll also be able to track the leads and new customers you send our way, along with your upcoming commission payments.

As we discussed in Step 1, Chrometa's affiliates are given their unique referral link immediately upon sign up.  They
are then directed to their Affiliate Dashboard, where they can access promotional tools and copy, and track their own
progress in real-time.

### Step 3: Introduce the Affiliate Dashboard

The more you can provide your affiliates with 1) Tools to promote your product, and 2) Accurate and immediate visibility
into their progress, the more engaged they will be in their promotion efforts.

We created an Affiliate Dashboard to display an affiliates' clicks, leads, and conversions in real-time.  It's very
motivating when they see these results!

Real-time metrics and progress updates via an Affiliate Dashboard will keep your affiliates motivated and engaged.

We also provide affiliates with a Social Content Sharing platform, which provides them with promotional content geared
for direct email, social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and banner ads for web sites and blogs, so that
they can begin promoting your product with a single-click of the mouse.

It's important that you provide starter copy and materials for them - again so that they can get rolling immediately,
and not have to be burdened with creating their own copy and materials from scratch.

When it comes to successful affiliate recruitment, it's all about convenience and motivation.  Make it ridiculously
convenient for your affiliates to get started - and keep them motivated and engaged once they are going - and you'll
be on the way to great sales and promotions with your affiliate program.
