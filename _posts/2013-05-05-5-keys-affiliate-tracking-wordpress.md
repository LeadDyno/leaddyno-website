Here's a rundown of 5 new features we want to make sure you're aware of - they will give you more leverage in your
marketing efforts, and ultimately drive more sales for you.  Please Reply, Call, or hop on Live Chat (via our site
and/or app) if we can be of assistance.

### 1) The New Affiliate Dashboard: Real-Time Progress Updates

Your affiliates can track their own progress in real-time via their **[Affiliate Dashboard](http://leaddyno.com/affiliate-dashboard/)**.
You will provide them with a unique link to their dashboard, so that they can monitor the  visitors, leads, customers,
and commissions they have received credit for.

The Affiliate Dashboard is an important resource for keeping affiliates engaged in their sales efforts. The real-time
access to their statistics is both reassuring and motivating, as they can be sure that they are getting credit for the
traffic they send your way.

Many LeadDyno users advertise this capability front and center when they bring on new affiliates.

### 2) Affiliate Promotional Materials

The **[Affiliate Dashboard](http://leaddyno.com/affiliate-dashboard/)** is also the place where your
affiliates can access promotional and social media materials for their own marketing efforts.  

Here, they can:

* Access their affiliate link.
* Download promotional materials (such as banner ads) for their website.
* Broadcast their link to social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google Plus.
* Generate a promotional email to send to their list with a single click.

We highlight these features in more details in our
**[Affiliate Management](http://leaddyno.com/affiliate-tracking-software/affiliate-management/)** section.

### 3) Social Media Content Sharing

Research shows that your affiliates are far more likely to promote your product if you provide specific editorial copy
for them to repurpose. Unique content from you – such as product announcements and editorials – greatly help
affiliates reach out to their audiences, readers, and followers with unique and valuable content.

LeadDyno’s **Social Content** portal provides you with a one stop shop for posting exactly this type of
email content, articles, and social media copy ready for immediate affiliate broadcast via Email, Twitter, Facebook,
LinkedIn, and Google Plus.

### 4) Weekly Update Emails for Affiliates

Send a customized welcome email to new affiliates as they come onboard. Also, configure a weekly progress email that
is sent automatically to update your affiliates on their leads and sales, keeping them actively engaged in the
promotion of your product.

### 5) Track Visitors & Sales Pipeline in Real-Time

Our new click code is a breeze to install, and will immediately show you how your website visitors found you.  This all
rolls up into our new Pipeline Dashboard, which updates your site Visitors, Leads, and Customers in real-time.

### Drive More Leads with LeadDyno Today
Affiliate and referral-based marketing is arguably the most cost effective form of marketing you can do online (and I
would argue it is THE most effective, because significant public relations coverage is unlikely for most businesses).
With LeadDyno, we help you get a new affiliate program up and running as quickly as possible.

Current LeadDyno subscribers can log into LeadDyno at https://app.leaddyno.com/users/sign_in to begin taking advantage
of these new features immediately.
