Unique content from you – such as product announcements and editorials – greatly help affiliates reach out to their audiences, readers, and followers with unique and valuable content.

Research shows that your affiliates are far more likely to promote your product if you provide specific editorial copy for them to repurpose.

Our **Social Content** portal provides you with a one stop shop for posting exactly this type of email content, articles, and social media copy ready for immediate affiliate broadcast via Email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Plus.


####Setting Up Your Social Content

To write your core social content, click the **Social Content** link in the left-hand navigation bar.

Here's where you'll write the promotional copy that your affiliates can send out with a single click via their **Affiliate Dashboard**.

Enter your initial promotional copy for your affiliates for use via Email, Twitter, Facebook, and/or LinkedIn, and click the **Update** button in the upper-right corner to save it.

####View From the Affiliate Dashboard

Here's the view from your affiliates' vantage point, via their **Affiliate Dashboard**.
With a single click, they can share their affiliate link - along with your promotional copy - with their entire professional and social network via Email, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google Plus.

####Email Promotion Example

![core_email_content](/img/core_email_content_ug3.png)

Your marketing or content manager can quickly create predefined email templates for your affiliates. You write the copy, or pull it from existing materials, and it’ll instantly become available to your affiliates.

Here’s the header and first paragraph of a referral email that was created using LeadDyno’s Email Referral Tool:

To send an email like this, your affiliate will simply click the **Email** button in their **Affiliate Dashboard**, and this pre-written email – which includes their unique referral link – will be pulled up in their email client. The email can be sent as-is, or edited prior to sending.

####Twitter Promotion Example

Promoted tweets are even easier to setup than emails – just input your 140 characters or less, and your affiliates can Tweet to their followers. Because Twitter is a less invasive medium, you can change this copy quite often for frequent Tweeting.

####Facebook Promotion Example

![core_facebook_post](/img/core_facebook_post_ug3.png)

Facebook posts are the same to setup as Twitter - just make sure your links point to a domain owned by your Facebook app. You can use more than 140 characters in a Facebook post.

####LinkedIn Promotion Example

![core_linkedin_content](/img/core_linkedin_content_ug3.png)


LinkedIn is similar to the previous two - except there is no 140 character requirement, nor is there an app ownership requirement.
