## Wufoo Integration Guide

### Introduction

It is very easy to design LeadDyno-enabled lead capture forms with WuFoo.

### Connecting To WuFoo

To get started, visit the **LeadDyno Tools** section, under **Settings** and click the **Build A Lead Capture Form**:

Next, either log in or sign up for a WuFoo account.  After you log in you can either select an existing form or
create a new form:

  <strong>Note:</strong> Your lead capture form must contain an email input to integrate properly with LeadDyno
</p>

Once you've created or selected your lead form, click the **Insert** button in the Wufoo form UI, and you will see
the javascript for your lead capture form, with LeadDyno integrated:
