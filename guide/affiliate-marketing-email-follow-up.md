## Automated Affiliate Emails

LeadDyno is designed to automate your affiliate program as much as possible, and one of the best tools for doing so
is email.  LeadDyno allows you to send emails to affiliates on various events to provide them information as well as
keep them engaged:

* When an affiliate is created or signs up
* When a lead signs up from an affiliate
