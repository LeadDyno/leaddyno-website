## Creating Additional Affiliate Marketing Material

The main LeadDyno affiliate dashboard provides quick and simple ways for affiliates to broadcast your core
marketing messages, but you often want to provide additional content for your affiliates: Banners, additional
tweets or Facebook posts, or email templates.

To support this, LeadDyno provides the **Additional Affiliate Content** UI.

Content that you create here will show up under the **Marketing Materials** tab on your affiliates dashboard:

Note that any links you create in your content will be specialized for the affiliate, so you can just make them point
to your site.

### Creating Banners

Creating a banner for your affiliates is a simple process.

First select **Banner/HTML Content** from the **Add Content** menu.

Next click the **Add Image** button in the HTML editor:

Which will prompt you to upload or select an existing online image:

Once you upload the image, click once on it in the editor, and fill in the **Link** field with a link to your site.

And you've created an affiliate banner!

Click the **Save Content** button at the top of the page, and your banner should now be available to your affiliates
on their dashboard.

### Creating Other Content

Creating other marketing materials is as simple as selecting the content type you want to create and then
filling in the actual marketing content.
