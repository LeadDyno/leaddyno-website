## Introduction To Tracking Campaigns

Affiliates will not be your only source of online leads, of course, and LeadDyno makes it easy to apply the same
tracking logic used for your affiliate program to other online channels, via **Tracking Campaigns**.

You can create distinct tracking campaigns for your various online marketing channels (such as
[Email](/guide/online-marketing-software-email-tracking.html) and [AdWords](/guide/pay-per-click-tracking-software.html))
and see exactly how many clicks, leads, conversions and cancellations you are getting from each channel.

### Creating a Tracking Campaign

####Fields

#### Campaign Code

This is the short name/code for the campaign (e.g. AdWords - Affiliate Tracking)

#### Name/Description

This is an optional field allowing you to give the campaign a more descriptive name

#### Group Name

This is an optional field allowing you to give campaigns within the same group a common tag.  It is used, for example
to group all your (automatically generated) Affiliate Newsletter campaigns together.

### Using a Tracking Campaign

Once you've created a Tracking Campaign, you will be taken its dashboard:

![Creating A Tracking Campaign](/img/tracking_campaign_show.png)

where you can see the unique tracking link for the campaign.

You can copy the link to your clip board by clicking the **Copy To Clipboard** button, and then use that link as the
target for your online marketing efforts.

#### Changing the Campaign's target URL

The tracking information in the campaign link is encoded in the trailing hash.  You can change the URL before the hash
to point to any destination you'd like.  So the above campaign link could be modified to `http://yoursite.com/special_offer#_l_3a`
and will continue to track correctly.

### Example Usage

We have documents outlining how to use Tracking Campaigns for both
[Email](/guide/online-marketing-software-email-tracking.html) and [AdWords](/guide/pay-per-click-tracking-software.html),
both of which we use very effectively for LeadDyno itself.
