## Banner Ad Conversion Tracking

While your publisher will normally provide you with a click report for your banner ads, they will not do the same for
leads and conversions.  These are up to you to track â€“ and this is where LeadDyno comes in.

You can create a new LeadDyno [Tracking Campaign](/guide/tracking-campaigns.html) for each banner ad campaign, so that you can
also track the leads and conversions that you are generating from your ads.

We would recommend creating a unique link per site, so that you can measure the quality of traffic that is being sent your way from each website.

Link your banner ads to LeadDyno tracking links, so that you can measure not only Clicks, but Leads and Conversions as
well.
