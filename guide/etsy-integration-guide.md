## Etsy Integration Guide

### Introduction

LeadDyno offers a One-click integration with Esty, making it incredibly easy to get an affiliate program going for
your Etsy shop.

Because Etsy does not allow modification of your sites HTML, the LeadDyno affiliate program is
based on **Discount/Affiliate Codes**, not on affiliate links.

### Connecting To Etsy

First visit the **E-Commerce Services** Tab of the Integrations section:

Or click [Here](https://app.leaddyno.com/settings/integrations/e-commerce) if you already have a LeadDyno account.

Next click on the **Connect To Etsy** button.  You will be taken to etsy:

template:

#### Configuring Your Affiliate Coupons

You can set up the default discount information for your coupon in the **Affiliate Coupon Configuration** section.  This
configuration is similar to the Etsy Coupon Configuration dialog.

##### Discount Type

The discount type can either be a percentage or a fixed amount.

##### Amount

This is the amount of the discount.  Note that a value of 20 means 20%.

##### Minimum Purchase

This is the minimum purchase amount for the coupon to be valid for.

Once you have filled in your coupon template information, click the **Save Coupon Configuration** button.

#### Creating Coupons For Affiliates

To create a coupon code for an affiliate, create a unique affiliate code for your affiliate.:

![Shopify Setup](/img/etsy_edit_code.png)

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Affiliate codes must be at least four characters long to be valid Etsy coupon codes.
</div>

Next you will need to activate this affiliate code as a discount code in Etsy by clicking the **Activate Etsy Coupon**
button:

![Shopify Setup](/img/etsy_activate.png)

If you ever decide to deactivate the affiliates coupon code, you can click the **Deactivate Etsy Coupon**

### Configuring Or Disconnecting From Esty

If you wish to disconnect from Etsy or adjust your Etsy configuration, you can return to
the **E-Commerce Services** Tab of the Integrations section:

![Shopify Setup](/img/etsy_disconnect.png)

### Purchase Synchronization

LeadDyno will sync with Etsy purchase information every two hours, so you may not see purchase information immediately.

You can sync immediately by clicking the **Sync Etsy Purchases Now** button in your Etsy configuration:

### Conclusion

At this point your Etsy shop will be fully integrated with LeadDyno.  Good luck selling!
