### Enter Revenue Per Conversion

In the top portion of the **New Compensation Plan** form, enter the amount of revenue that you receive per sale.  This
will be used to calculate your affiliate commissions if you are awarding a percentage of sales.

You can create a new plan for each additional product that you sell.

### Enter Affiliate Compensation

Next you'll define your affiliate compensation.  Use the **+** button on the right to add a line (if, for example, you
are doing a combination compensation of a one-time reward plus a monthly percentage).

 * Month - the time period you will be paying your affiliate his or her commission.  Scroll down for options for
perpetual payments.
* Compensation - can be a fixed reward, or a percentage of sales.
