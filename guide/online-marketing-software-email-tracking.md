## Email Marketing Tracking

The [Tracking Campaign](/guide/tracking-campaigns.html) feature in LeadDyno is an excellent way to track the exact number of
Clicks, Leads, and Conversions you are receiving from your email marketing dollars.

To do so, simply create a **New Tracking Campaign** to track the results of an upcoming email campaign.  Place the
Unique Referral Link as your call to action link, so that LeadDyno can track the clicks, leads, and conversions you receive
from the email.

Note: By default the link will point to your homepage.  If you prefer to direct traffic to a specific landing page
within your domain, simply place the tracking portion - from the "#" on - directly after the URL you are using as your
landing page.

For example: www.yourdomain.com/blog#_l_3a will track traffic and send visitors to www.yourdomain.com/blog.

### Email Call-To-Action Example

Here's an example of a sponsored email advertisement, with a call-to-action that is being tracked via LeadDyno.  The
call-to-action at the end of the ad is hyperlinked to a LeadDyno campaign referral link.
