###Online & Email Marketing Tracking

Next time you invest in pay-per-click marketing, banner ads, and/or sponsored emails, use LeadDyno to track your results 
and calculate your return on investment.

####Using Marketing Campaign Tracking Links

After you create a new campaign, you will be redirected to the Campaign Info screen, which contains a Unique Referral
Link. Hit CTRL-C to copy this link to your clipboard.

####Email Tracking Links

Use the campaign tracking feature in LeadDyno to track the exact number of Clicks, Leads, and Conversions you are
receiving from your email marketing dollars.

Create a **New Campaign** to track the results of an upcoming email campaign.  Place the Unique Referral Link as your
call to action link, so that LeadDyno can track the clicks, leads, and conversions you receive from the email.

Note: By default the link will point to your homepage.  If you prefer to direct traffic to a specific landing page
within your domain, simply place the tracking portion - from the "?" on - directly after the URL you are using as your
landing page.

For example: www.yourdomain.com/blog?afmc=abcde12345 will track traffic and send visitors to www.yourdomain.com/blog.

####Email Call-To-Action Example

Here's an example of a sponsored email advertisement, with a call-to-action that is being tracked via LeadDyno.  The
call-to-action at the end of the ad is hyperlinked to a LeadDyno campaign referral link.
