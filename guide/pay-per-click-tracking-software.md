## Pay Per Click Tracking

Use LeadDyno's pay per click tracking to measure your PPC advertising investments alongside your other marketing efforts
to see which ad groups and PPC mediums are bringing you the highest quantity AND quality of leads and conversions.

### Using Marketing Campaign Tracking Links

Create a tracking link for your next online advertising campaign by selecting the **Marketing - Campaigns** link in the
navigation menu. Then click the **Create New Campaign** button.

After you create a new campaign, you will be redirected to the Campaign Info screen, which contains a Unique Referral
Link.

Click the copy button to copy this link to your clipboard.

### Google Adwords Conversion Tracking

We recommend using a unique LeadDyno tracking link for each Ad Group you are running within Google Adwords.  Place this
link as the Actual URL for each ad that you create within the Ad Group.

The bottom field contains a LeadDyno tracking link for this ad.

This will place your pay-per-click lead and conversion tracking alongside your other marketing channels, so that you can
compare the various mediums and campaigns side by side.

### Comparing Different Marketing Channels

Here’s an example of an Adwords campaign, compared with a banner ad campaign (Attorney At Work), and email campaign
(TechnoLawyer), and a Google Adsense campaign (Excel Timesheet).  Our Adwords campaign brought us only the
third-highest amount of clicks – but it brought the most leads, and more conversions than the other three campaigns
combined!

Our Google Adwords campaign (top row) trumps the following three when comparing leads, and especially conversions.

### Google Adsense Conversion Tracking

We recommend the same link placement when running an Adsense campaign (also called Google’s Content Network).  Place a
unique LeadDyno tracking link as the Actual URL for each ad within a distinct Ad Group.

Here’s an example of an Adsense / Content Network ad, with the LeadDyno tracking link located in the bottom field.

### Why Split By Ad Group?

We recommend segmenting your LeadDyno campaigns by Ad Group because we believe this is the largest determining factor in
the quality of the leads you are generating.  Ads are meant to be split-tested in order to boost response rates, but
ad groups indicate the motivation – and likelihood of buying – of your prospect.

So we recommend “controlling” at the Ad Group level, which is the most detailed level of lead and conversion information
you need.  These numbers will also roll up and show you how well Google Adwords and Adsense are working out for you in
general.

### Banner Ad Conversion Tracking

While your publisher will normally provide you with a click report for your banner ads, they will not do the same for
leads and conversions.  These are up to you to track – and this is where LeadDyno comes in.

Create a new LeadDyno campaign for each banner ad campaign, so that you can also track the leads and conversions that
you are generating from your ads.  We would recommend creating a unique link per site, so that you can measure the
quality of traffic that is being sent your way from each website.

Link your banner ads to LeadDyno tracking links, so that you can measure not only Clicks, but Leads and Conversions as
well.
