## Affiliate Management

Affiliates can track their own progress in real-time via their Affiliate Dashboard.  You will provide them with a unique
link to their dashboard, so that they can monitor their visitors, leads, customers, and payments.

### New Affiliate Setup

Here's how to setup your **Affiliate Program** in just a few minutes with LeadDyno's industry leading **affiliate tracking software**.


To set up a new affiliate, [click the **Affiliates** link](https://app.leaddyno.com/affiliates) in the left-hand
navigation bar.

![affiliate_management_menu](/img/affiliate_management_menu_ug1.png)

Then, click the **Add New Affiliate** button, located in the upper-right. 

![add_new_affiliate_buttom](/img/add_new_affiliate_buttom_ug1.png)

Enter the email address of your affiliate - this serves as their unique identifier in LeadDyno. You may also enter their
name, and their compensation tier, if you have different compensation plans (which you can set up
[via the **Comp Plan** option](https://app.leaddyno.com/plans) in the **Affiliates** menu).

Then click **Create**, and your new affiliate will be setup. LeadDyno will then create two links for you to give them.

### Unique Referral Link

Affiliates will send traffic your way via their unique referral link, which will track the clicks, leads, and
conversions that come from each affiliate.

Hit Control+C (Command+C on a Mac) to copy this new affiliate link to your clipboard.


### Defining Clicks, Leads, and Conversions

Here's how we define these terms in LeadDyno:
* A **Click** is a visitor that clicks from somewhere else on the web to your website. We track the original source of this click (ie. affiliate, pay-per-click ad, blog post)
* A **Lead** is someone who gives you their email address (ie. signs up for your free newsletter)
* A **Conversion** is a lead who purchases your product.

For some online businesses, the lead and conversion occur at the same time. For others, the lead is gathered prior to
a sales cycle that results in the lead converting. Both approaches are supported by LeadDyno. It's also important to
note that LeadDyno tracks every sale back to its original lead source - no matter how much time passes between the
conversion and its initial click.

### Affiliate Dashboard

Affiliates can track their own progress in real-time via their affiliate dashboard. You will provide them with a unique link to their dashboard, so that they can monitor their current clicks, leads, and conversions.

### Manage & Create Multiple Referral Links

You can manage an affiliate's links - and provide them with additional referral links - via their affiliate screen. The
**Links** tab displays a table with their link statistics to date.

![affiliate_links_table](/img/affiliate_links_table_ug1.png)

Click the **Add New Link** button to create an additional link for the selected affiliate. This can be used to track
the results of different marketing campaigns separately, while still crediting payments to the appropriate affiliate.

### View Affiliate Leads

The **Referrers** tab, just to the right of the Conversions tab, displays the referral sources for the affiliate. Click
the URL of the referrer to see its entire statistics of clicks, leads, and conversions.

### Affiliate Commissions At-A-Glance

The final tab in the affiliate table, **Commissions**, will display the upcoming commissions payable to the affiliate.
