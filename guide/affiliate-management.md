## Affiliate Management

Affiliate Management is very simple with LeadDyno.  In a few clicks you can create, monitor and compensate your
affiliates.  By using <a href="affiliate-marketing-email-follow-up.html">automated affiliate emails</a> and
<a href="lead-follow-up-email-software.html">viral lead emails</a>, you can **automate the vast majority of your
affiliate program**.

### New Affiliate Setup

in the left-hand navigation bar.

Fill in at least an email address for the affiliate.

#### Affiliate Fields

##### Email

The Affiliates email address.

##### Affiliate Type

LeadDyno allows you to create different Affiliate Types and compensate them differently.  This is useful if you have,
for example, formal resellers that you wish to enter into a special agreement with.

##### First Name/Last Name

The Affiliates name.


##### Affiliate Code

A custom affiliate code for this affiliate (will be part of their affiliate link, and can be used in discount-code
style affiliate programs).

##### Referring Affiliate

The affiliate who referred this affiliate.  Used when setting up a [Multi-tier Affiliate Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing#Multi-tier_programs)

When you are done, click the **Save Affiliate** button

### Affiliate Overview Screen

After you create an affiliate, you will be taken to their overview screen:

![show_affiliate](/img/show_affiliate.png)

On this screen you can monitor the affiliates progress, see how many commissions they are due and what commissions
are upcoming, as well as see the specific visitors, leads and purchases they have driven.

### Unique Affiliate Referral Link

Affiliates will send traffic your way via their unique affiliate referral link, which will track the clicks, leads, and
conversions that come from each affiliate.

![affiliate_link](/img/affiliate_link.png)

You can copy this link by clicking the **Copy Link** button.

### Affiliate Dashboard

Affiliates can track their own progress in real-time via their affiliate dashboard. LeadDyno creates a single-signon
link that you can send to your affiliate which will automatically log them in and show them their desktop:

![affiliate-dashboard-link](/img/affiliate-dashboard-link.png)

This link will take the affiliate to their affiliate dashboard.  Here is an example:

![affiliate_dashboard_sample](/img/affiliate_dashboard_sample.png)

You can also click on this link to automatically log yourself in as the affiliate, so you can see what their dashboard
looks like.

### Defining Clicks, Leads, and Conversions

Here's how we define these terms in LeadDyno:
* A **Click** is a visitor that clicks from somewhere else on the web to your website. We track the original source of this click (ie. affiliate, pay-per-click ad, blog post)
* A **Lead** is someone who gives you their email address (ie. signs up for your free newsletter)
* A **Conversion** is a lead who purchases your product.

![affiliate_clicks_leads_conv](/img/affiliate_clicks_leads_conv_ug1.jpg)

For some online businesses, the lead and conversion occur at the same time. For others, the lead is gathered prior to
a sales cycle that results in the lead converting. Both approaches are supported by LeadDyno. It's also important to
note that LeadDyno tracks every sale back to its original lead source - no matter how much time passes between the
conversion and its initial click.
