## Customizing Your Affiliate Home Page

Your **Affiliate Home Page** is the home page for your LeadDyno-powered affiliate program.  You can find a link
to it on your account page [here](https://app.leaddyno.com/settings/account) and it will look something like `http://youraccountname.leaddyno.com`
.

You can customize the entire look, feel, and content of your **Affiliate Home Page** on the
[Configure Affiliate Website](https://app.leaddyno.com/content/website_customization) page within
LeadDyno.

#### Customization Options


##### Enable Custom Header

By turning on **Enable Custom Header** you can change the content of the header of your Affiliate Dashboard by using
the **Custom Header Content** editor.  This allows you to embed images, change the title of the Affiliate Home Page
and so on.

##### Site Accent Color

By default your Affiliate Home Page will use LeadDyno green as it's accent color.  If you wish to change this, you can
set it using the **Site Accent Color** color picker.  This is a great way to brand your Affiliate Home Page.

##### Website Introduction Content

If you'd like to customize the text content on your homepage, you can provide custom content in the **Website Introduction Content**
editor.  You might use this to tell potential affiliates what your commission structure is, or stress certain terms
and conditions of the affiliate program.

##### Custom CSS

By enabling **Custom CSS** you gain full control over the styling of your Affiliate Home Page.  LeadDyno will load
the CSS file you specify in the **Custom CSS URL** and allow it to override the default styling.

##### Enable IFrame Mode

By enabling **IFrame Mode** your affiliate home page (and affiliate's dashboards) will be rendered with no surrounding
navigational elements, allowing you to embed the site via an iframe in your own website.  Note that, if you do this,
you will be responsible for providing navigational elements to secondary pages, like Affiliate Newsletters.
