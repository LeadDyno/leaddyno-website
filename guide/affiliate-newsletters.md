## Affiliate Newsletters

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Affiliate Newsletters are a <strong>beta</strong> feature, and this functionality may
  change or be extended in the future.
</div>

Affiliate newsletters let you keep your affiliates engaged in selling your product.  You can use them to let your
affiliates know about new features, sales or products you have, as well as providing them updates on the affiliate
program (e.g. congratulating a top affiliate.)

Affiliate newsletters are sent via email to your affiliates.

### Creating An Affiliate Newsletter

You can create a new Affiliate Newsletter by clicking the **New Affiliate Newsletter** button on the **Affiliate
Newsletters** section within **Affiliate Content**.

You will be taken to the Newsletter editor:

#### From

You can pick any email address you'd like to use for your sending your affiliate newsletters, but LeadDyno will need to
validate your ownership of the email address before publishing the newsletter.

#### Subject

A meaningful subject will help your open rate, but try to avoid making it appear too much like a spam subject to
avoid being filtered by your affiliates email systems.

#### Newsletter Body

This is the content of your newsletter, which will be sent to all your (non-archived) affiliates.  See below for
tips on writing an effective newsletter body.

Once you are done editing the newsletter, you can click **Save**.  Note that this will **not** publish the newsletter.

### Writing Effective Affiliate Newsletters

Your affiliates and resellers will appreciate getting the "inside track" from you in the form of an affiliate newsletter.
Hearing from you directly will keep them engaged and motivated as they sell your products and programs.

Here are a few tips for writing effective affiliate newsletters that help your "virtual sales team" sell:

* When you've got something new, let your affiliates know first. They will appreciate the inside scoop.
* Update your "one-click" social sharing content with fresh materials - so that they can spread the word as soon as they
get your email.
* Have new banner ads? Get those uploaded before you send the newsletter too.
* Make sure your commissions are up-to-date... and pay bonuses when appropriate!
* Upcoming commissions are the first thing your affiliates will check when they hear from you. From a motivational
  standpoint, you can't beat having upcoming money teed up for them.

Affiliate newsletters should balance the length of content with actionable items (see "Embedding Content" below.)

Do not assume that your affiliates have the time to deeply understand your new features or your offer, and make it as
simple as possible for them to get your marketing message through to their channels.

#### Embedding Content In Your Newsletter

An effective way to engage your affiliates is to include [marketing content](/guide/content.html) in your newsletter.
LeadDyno allows you to create "One Click" content sharing links in your newsletters, so that affiliates can share the
content directly from their newsletter.  Below are two examples of embedding content.

##### Example 1: Embedding A Tweet

Create a new tweet, as outlined in the [marketing content](/guide/content.html).  On the information page for the
tweet, click the **Copy Sharing URL** button:

![content_list](/img/newsletter_tweet_embed1.png)

Now, in your newsletter, create a link to that sharing URL by creating some text that explains the tweet and select
that text, then click the **link** button and select **Insert Link**:

![content_list](/img/newsletter_tweet_embed2.png)

Now paste in the sharing URL that you copied and click **Insert**

![content_list](/img/newsletter_tweet_embed3.png)

Congratulations, you've now created an embedded one-click tweet in your newsletters!  When an affiliate clicks on the
link they will be sent directly to twitter to publish the tweet.

##### Example 2: Embedding A Banner

As with a tweet, you'll first need to create a banner in the [marketing content](/guide/content.html) area.  In this
case I recommend you open the information page for the banner in a new tab, because you will be copying two elements.

First, you can copy the HTML for the banner by highlighting the banner in the **Body** section and hitting **CTRL-C**.

![content_list](/img/newsletter_banner_embed2.png)

You can then switch to the tab you are composing your newsletter in and insert the banner by hitting **CTRL-V**

![content_list](/img/newsletter_banner_embed1.png)

Now return to the banner tab and click **Copy Sharing URL**.  Switch back to the newsletter editor and add a
descriptive link below the banner, using the copied sharing URL:

![content_list](/img/newsletter_banner_embed3.png)

When your affiliate clicks on this link, they will be taken to a specialized version of the banner containing their
tracking link:

![content_list](/img/newsletter_banner_embed4.png)

which they can then copy and share.

### Testing Your Newsletter

After you have saved your newsletter, you will likely want to test the newsletter out before sending it off to make
sure that the formatting and content is all rendering correctly.  To do so click on the **Send Test** button, which
will prompt you for an email to send a test version of the newsletter to.

![content_list](/img/newsletter_send_test.png)

Once you have verified that the newsletter appears the way that you'd like to to, you are ready to publish.

### Publishing Your Newsletter

To publish your newsletter, click the **Publish** button.  LeadDyno will begin publishing your newsletter, and will
show a progress bar (as well as a cancel button).

Congratulations, you've published your first affiliate newsletter!

### Newsletter Archives

All newsletters that you create will be available on your affiliate dashboard under the **Newsletters** tab, so even
if an affiliate joins your program after you publish a newsletter, they will have an opportunity to read the newsletters
and utilize the content in them:
