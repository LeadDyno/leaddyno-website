## LeadDyno Introduction

LeadDyno provides you a simple, automated system for running an affiliate program and tracking where your leads
are coming from.  Getting started can take as little as a few hours and, with our premium plans, LeadDyno
developers can assist you and your team as you get LeadDyno dialed in for your website.

Below is an overview of what LeadDyno can do for you.

### Installation

[Installation](installation.html) of LeadDyno typically involves a three steps:

1. Add a bit of Javascript to your site header, similar to google analytics.  This will [track the
   visitors](installation.html#visitor_tracking) to your site.
2. Add a bit more Javascript to [capture customer emails](installation.html#lead_tracking) as well.
3. Finally, depending on how your online business works, you will need to implement
   [purchase tracking](http://localhost:4000/guide/installation.html#purchase_tracking)

Typically this can all be done quickly by your web developers.

Note that if you are using a platform like [PayPal](paypal-integration-guide.html) or
[Shopify](shopify-integration-guide.html), you may not need to do all the work above, as LeadDyno provides excellent
integrations with them.

### Customizing Your Affiliate Home Page

LeadDyno provides you with a custom Affiliate Home Page, which you can find on your
[Account Page](https://app.leaddyno.com/settings/account)

New affiliate can sign up from this page, and existing affiliates can log in to their Affiliate Dashboard, to monitor
their progress.

You can customize affiliate home page in the [Configure Affiliate Website](https://app.leaddyno.com/content/website_customization)
page of LeadDyno.

Additionally, you can configure the language that affiliates see on their Dashboard on the
[Configure Affiliate Dashboard](https://app.leaddyno.com/content/dashboard_customization) page.

### Creating Commission Plans

In order to compensate your affiliates, you can design [Commission Plans](affiliate-compensation-plan.html), allowing you to
pay commissions over a period of time, as a percentage of sales, as a fixed amount and even as a
[multi-tiered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing#Multi-tier_programs) affiliate program.

### Creating Social Content For Your Affiliates

You know how to market your product better than your affiliates will.  LeadDyno allows you to author content for
your affiliates to broadcast via social networks, email and the web.

The [Core Social Content](https://app.leaddyno.com/content) section of LeadDyno allows you to author the content that
will be broadcast from the sharing buttons on your affiliate's dashboard.

The [Additional Affiliate Content](https://app.leaddyno.com/content/affiliate_content) section of LeadDyno
allows you to author additional content for the affiliate to share (e.g. banners, additional tweets or facebook posts,
etc.)

### Staying In Touch With Your Affiliates

LeadDyno's [Automated Affiliate Emails](https://app.leaddyno.com/affiliate_emails) provide an easy way to stay in touch
with and motivate your affiliates.

Additionally, you can use [Affiliate Newsletters](https://app.leaddyno.com/affiliate_campaigns) to get fresh content
out to your affiliates and keep them engaged.

### Turning Customers Into Affiliates

One of the most powerful concepts in online marketing is [Viral Marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing).

LeadDyno automates this process of turning your customers into affiliates and champions for your product by allowing you
to create [Viral Emails](viral-email-setup.html) that will provide one-click affiliate sign-up or one-click social sharing.

### Managing and Paying Your Affiliates

LeadDyno allows you to pay your affiliates in various ways: online via PayPal or Dwolla, or manually via check or
money order.  Creating new affiliates is simple and efficient, and will create a new custom affiliate dashboard
for each affiliate you add.

### Digging Deeper...

LeadDyno provides much more than affiliate management.  Here are a few other features you can use to optimize your
 online marketing efforts

#### AdWords Tracking

The same tracking technology that LeadDyno uses for affiliate tracking can be used to optimize your AdWords spend.
Which campaigns are producing the most leads?  The most purchases?  The fewest cancellations or refunds?  Understanding
this is easy when you use LeadDyno Campaigns to track AdWords.

#### Email List Tracking

Another common online marketing channel is via email lists

#### CRM Integration

LeadDyno integrates with common CRM applications as a lead generation front end, pushing lead source information into
Salesforce, SugarCRM or InfusionSoft.  If you use other online marketing tools like MailChip, we've probably got an
integration for you as well.

#### Lead Follow Up &amp; Drip Sequences

In addition to viral-style emails, LeadDyno provides simple lead follow up email functionality, which you can use to
engage your customers, thank them for purchases, inquire after cancellations, etc.  And of course, if you have more
elaborate email marketing needs, LeadDyno integrates with industry standard tools like InfustionSoft and MailChimp.
