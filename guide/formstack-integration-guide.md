## formstack Integration Guide

### Introduction

LeadDyno gives you a few options for building LeadDyno-powered forms with Formstack.  Below is documentation on each
mechanism.

### Adding LeadDyno Tracking To Existing Forms

To add LeadDyno tracking to your existing forms, go to the **Online Tools** Tab in the **Manage Integrations** Section
under **Settings**:

Click the **Connect To Fromstack** button:

And you will be taken to Formstack, which will ask you to log in (or create an account) and give LeadDyno
access to your forms:

![Formstack](/img/formstack-auth.png)

Click **Authorize** and you will be redirected back to LeadDyno, with a success message:

![Formstack](/img/formstack-success.png)

You will see a list of all your Formstack forms in the Formstack section of the integration UI.  You can now either add
LeadDyno tracking code to all your forms by clicking the **Add LeadDyno Tracking Code To All My Forms!** button:

![Formstack](/img/formstack-all.png)

Or you can add tracking code to individual forms by mousing over the row for the form and clicking the **Integrate With
LeadDyno** button that appears.

You can disconnect LeadDyno from your Formstack account by clicking the **Disconnect from Formstack** button.

### Building A New Formstack Lead Collection Form

If you do not have an existing lead collection form, or if you wish to create a new one, you can do so directly from
within LeadDyno.  In the **Settings** section, select **LeadDyno Tools**, then select the **Build A Lead Capture Form**
and pick **Formstack Forms**.

You will be presented with a new Contact Form:

![Formstack](/img/formstack-new.png)

Add the details you would like to the form, then click **Finish**.  LeadDyno will integrate with the newly created form
and show you a success message:

![Formstack](/img/formstack-new-finished.png)

You can now use this LeadDyno-powered Formstack form.

### Conclusion

With these two mechanisms, you can start creating LeadDyno-powered Formstack forms quickly and easily, powering more leads
and giving you a better handle on where your leads are coming from.
